# Agile Development Prequalified Vendor Pool 

In January 2017, the California Department of Technology, in partnership with the Office of Systems Integration (OSI), will conduct a Request for Information (RFI) to refresh the Agile Development Prequalified vendor pool that was established by the California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Agency in July 2016. 

The pool is designed to provide state agencies with access to user-centered design and agile software development services. The existing pool is comprised of 11 vendors and through the refresh process the pool could expand to include up to 30 vendors.  

You can also join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cur5Fn) to get updates about this initiative. 

###The Benefits:
* Reduction in solicitation time and administrative costs; and
* Ability to review vendors’ user-centric design and agile software development competencies prior to solicitation.

###The Process:
* The State will release the RFI online to all interested vendors (see original [CHHS RFI](https://github.com/ca-cwds/webdocs/raw/master/Procurements/RFI_75001_ADPQ_Vendor_Pool_050516.pdf)); 
* In response to the RFI submission requirements, vendors will provide a functioning prototype using open source technologies and a narrative description of the technical approach used to create the prototype; and
* The State will review each vendor’s prototype and technical approach (e.g., use of user-centered design) to establish a list of highly-qualified vendors to provide user-centered design and agile software development services

###Vendor Screening
The vendor screening process will be determined by a pass/fail compliance review and by a technical review of the vendor’s working prototype and technical approach. The vendor’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype shall be reviewed to assess the vendor’s understanding and capability to supply user-centered design and agile software development services. The State intends to select vendors who achieve the highest rating in regards to their prototype and description of their technical approach. The three ratings associated with the screening and selection process are: Exceptional, Acceptable, and Not Acceptable.

The following scenarios are conditions that shall constitute a Not Acceptable rating and will disqualify a vendor from being selected to participate in the vendor pool:
* If a commit is made to the branch subject to review after the Submission Due Date.
* If the code, or any design asset, of the prototype is changed on the GitHub server after the Submission Due Date.
* If accessing the prototype via the publicly-available URL identified at the top of the README.md file generates HTTP 4xx or 5xx errors.

###Vendor Pool Questions & Issues
If you have a question or issue please submit a [Github Issue](https://github.com/CDTProcurement/adpq/issues)(we'd prefer that, to keep things in the open). With respect to questions or issues, please describe the subject or issue in question and any other information useful in identifying the specific problem or issue stated in your question.

###Vendor Pool Briefing
On December 19, the State conducted a [briefing and Q & A session](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/recording/8319859731309150465) for interested vendors. A comprehensive Q & A document will be available here once it is complete. 

###Feedback and Lessons Learned
Following the first screening process, OSI conducted a [debriefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m5uKC8mhKw&feature=youtu.be) to share feedback and lessons learned with vendors who participated in the RFI process.
