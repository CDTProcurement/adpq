# Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Agile Development - Digital Services 2018 Refresh 

The California Department of Technology (CDT) is conducting a Request for Interest (RFI) to refresh the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Agile Development - Digital Services (PQVP AD-DS) that was established in July 2016. 

The pool is designed to provide approved state agencies with access to user-centered design and agile software development services.

### The Benefits:
* Reduction in solicitation time and administrative costs for both the State and vendors
* Ability to review vendors’ user-centric design and agile software development competencies prior to solicitation

### The Process:
CDT officially released the RFI (see above files) on February 12, 2018.  CDT advises all interested parties, including incumbent vendors, to thoroughly review the RFI and adhere to any due dates indicated in Section A.1 PQVP AD-DS, Key Action Dates.
