# Digital Services - Agile Development Prequalified Vendor Pool Refresh 

In January 2017, the California Department of Technology, in partnership with the Office of Systems Integration (OSI), will conduct a Request for Information (RFI) to refresh the Agile Development Prequalified vendor pool that was established by the California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Agency in July 2016. 

The pool is designed to provide state agencies with access to user-centered design and agile software development services. The existing pool is comprised of 11 vendors and through the refresh process the pool could expand to include up to 30 vendors.  

You can also email our team (adpq@state.ca.gov) to get updates about this initiative. 

### The Benefits:
* Reduction in solicitation time and administrative costs; and
* Ability to review vendors’ user-centric design and agile software development competencies prior to solicitation.

### The Process:
* The State has released the RFI, Technical Prototypes, and a Q&A to all interested vendors (see above files). 


### The Results:
See the notification of selection notice sent out on Monday April 17, 2017

The California Department of Technology (CDT) advises all partcipants to review the Key Action Dates, Section A.1 PQVP DS-AD Key Action Dates.
