# Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Agile Development Services - 2021 Refresh 

The California Department of Technology (CDT) is looking to refresh the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool (PQVP) for Agile Development Services that was established in July 2016. 

The pool is designed to provide approved State Agencies/Departments with access to exceptional human-centered design and agile software development services.

### The Benefits:
* Reduction in solicitation time, response requirements, and related administrative costs for both the State and vendors
* Ability for the State to test, vet and pre-qualify vendors’ user-centric design and agile software development competencies prior to solicitation
* Potential for State Agencies/Departments to deliver innovative technologies and quality services to end-users at a faster pace

### The Process:
CDT will officially release a Request for Interest (RFI) in early-2021.  In the meantime, CDT encourages all interested parties to respond to the following survey to assist the State in shaping the next generation of PQPV:  https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZJ6K6C6.  This survey will close at 11:45 PM on November 30, 2020.   

Please continue to check back here periodically for update announcements.
 
### Vendor Pool Questions & Issues:
If you have any questions or issues, please email the CDT PQVP Team at PQVP@state.ca.gov.
